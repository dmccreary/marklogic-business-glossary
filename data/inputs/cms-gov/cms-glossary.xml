      <prefLabel>Medicare Evidence Development &amp; Coverage Advisory Committee (MEDCAC)(formerly

      <definition>The MEDCAC (formerly know as MCAC) advises CMS on whether specific medical items
         and services are reasonable and necessary under Medicare law. They perform this task via a
         careful review and discussion of specific clinical and scientific issues in an open and
         public forum. The MEDCAC (formerly know as MCAC) is advisory in nature, with the final
         decision on all issues resting with CMS. Accordingly, the advice rendered by the MEDCAC
         (formerly know as MCAC) is most useful when it results from a process of full scientific
         inquiry and thoughtful discussion, in an open forum, with careful framing of
         recommendations and clear identification of the basis of those recommendations. The MEDCAC
         (formerly know as MCAC) is used to supplement CMS's internal expertise and to ensure an
         unbiased and contemporary consideration of "state of the art" technology and science.
         Accordingly, MEDCAC (formerly know as MCAC) members are valued for their background,
         education, and expertise in a wide variety of scientific, clinical, and other related
         fields. In composing the MEDCAC (formerly know as MCAC), CMS was diligent in pursuing
         ethnic, gender, geographic, and other diverse views, and to carefully screen each member to
         determine potential conflicts of interest.</definition>

         up to the Medicare contractor to make the coverage decision (see LCD). Prior to an NCD
         taking effect, CMS must first issue a Manual Transmittal, CMS ruling, or Federal Register
         Notice giving specific directions to our claims-processing contractors. That issuance,
         which includes an effective date and implementation date, is the NCD. If appropriate, the
         Agency must also change billing and claims processing systems and issue related
         instructions to allow for payment. The NCD will be published in the Medicare National

         arising from the pre-1957 wage credits, and (b) amounts equivalent to the HI taxes that

         adjustments to the pre-1957 portion of the 1983 lump-sum transfer; (3) general fund
         transfers equivalent to HI taxes on military deemed wage credits for 1984 and later, to be

      <definition>Means any specialty, inpatient, outpatient or laboratory services that are ordered

         substantial financial risk. For example, an MCO may require a physician group/physician to
         authorize "retroactive" referrals for emergency care received outside the MCO's network. If
         the physician group/physician's payment from the MCO can be affected by the utilization of
         emergency care, such as a bonus if emergency referrals are low, then these emergency
         services are considered referral services and need to be included in the calculation of
         substantial financial risk. Also, if a physician group contracts with an individual
         physician or another group to provide services that the initial group cannot provide
         itself, any services referred to the contracted physician group/physician should be
         considered referral services.</definition>

      <prefLabel>SUMMARIZED COST RATE</prefLabel>
      <definition>The ratio of the present value of expenditures to the present value of the taxable

         reimbursed from the general fund of the Treasury, and for voluntary enrollees, who pay a
         premium in order to be enrolled. The summarized cost rate includes the cost of reaching and
         maintaining a "target" trust fund level, known as a contingency fund ratio. Because a trust
         fund level of about 1 year's expenditures is considered to be an adequate reserve for
         unforeseen contingencies, the targeted contingency fund ratio used in determining
         summarized cost rates is 100 percent of annual expenditures. Accordingly, the summarized
         cost rate is equal to the ratio of (1) the sum of the present value of the outgo during the
         period, plus the present value of the targeted ending trust fund level, plus the beginning
         trust fund level, to (2) the present value of the taxable payroll during the

      <definition>Summarized income rates and cost rates are calculated for each of 66 valuation
         periods within the full 75-year long-range projection period under the intermediate

         period becomes longer by 1 year, culminating with the period consisting of the next 75
         years. The long-range test is met if, for each of the 66 time periods, the actuarial
         balance is not less than zero or is negative by, at most, a specified percentage of the
         summarized cost rate for the same time period. The percentage allowed for a negative
         actuarial balance is 5 percent for the full 75-year period and is reduced uniformly for
         shorter periods, approaching zero as the duration of the time periods approaches the first
         10 years. The criterion for meeting the test is less stringent for the longer periods in
         recognition of the greater uncertainty associated with estimates for more distant years.
         This test is applied to trust fund projections made under the intermediate
         assumptions.</definition>

      <definition>The conditions required to meet this test are as follows: (1) If the trust fund
         ratio for a fund exceeds 100 percent at the beginning of the projection period, then it
         must be projected to remain at or above 100 percent throughout the 10-year projection
         period; (2) alternatively, if the fund ratio is initially less than 100 percent, it must be
         projected to reach a level of at least 100 percent within 5 years (and not be depleted at
         any time during this period), and then remain at or above 100 percent throughout the rest
         of the 10-year period. This test is applied to trust fund projections made under the
         intermediate assumptions.</definition>
