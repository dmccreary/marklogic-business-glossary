      <definition>CALs is an abbreviated process, similar to the NCD process, for making changes to

         NCDs when there is a question regarding whether the code flows from the narrative
         indications in the NCD. A tracking sheet is posted opening a CAL and a 30-day public
         comment period follows. A decision memorandum announcing and explaining the decision is
         posted following the comment period. Changes are implemented in the next available

      <definition>All employment and self-employment creditable for Social Security purposes. Almost

         affiliates of American employers, or the employer must elect State and local
         governments-coverage. However, effective July 1991, coverage is mandatory for State and
         local employees who are not participating in a public employee retirement system. All new
         State and local employees have been covered since April 1986. In a few situations-for
         instance, ministers or self-employed members of certain religious groups-workers can opt
         out of coverage. Covered employment for HI includes all federal employees (whereas covered

         for the service, and therefore may have a weaker incentive to conform to data collection

         fraudulent service. In a fully capitated environment, however, the provider would receive
         no additional reimbursement for the submission of a false positive encounter.</definition>

         procedures, or technologies on a national basis. Medicare contractors are required to
         follow NCDs. If an NCD does not specifically exclude/limit an indication or circumstance,
         or if the item or service is not mentioned at all in an NCD or in a Medicare manual, it is
         up to the Medicare contractor to make the coverage decision (see LCD). Prior to an NCD
         taking effect, CMS must first issue a Manual Transmittal, CMS ruling, or Federal Register
         Notice giving specific directions to our claims-processing contractors. That issuance,
         which includes an effective date and implementation date, is the NCD. If appropriate, the
         Agency must also change billing and claims processing systems and issue related
         instructions to allow for payment. The NCD will be published in the Medicare National
         Coverage Determinations Manual. An NCD becomes effective as of the date listed in the

         from the general fund of the Treasury to the HI trust fund for these costs. The Social
         Security Amendments of 1983 provided for (1) a lump-sum transfer in 1983 for (a) the costs
         arising from the pre-1957 wage credits, and (b) amounts equivalent to the HI taxes that
         would have been paid on the deemed wage credits for military service for 1966 through 1983,
         inclusive, if such credits had been counted as covered earnings; (2) quinquennial
         adjustments to the pre-1957 portion of the 1983 lump-sum transfer; (3) general fund
         transfers equivalent to HI taxes on military deemed wage credits for 1984 and later, to be
         credited to the fund on July 1 of each year; and (4) adjustments as deemed necessary to any

      <definition>Means any specialty, inpatient, outpatient or laboratory services that are ordered
         or arranged, but not furnished directly. Certain situations may exist that should be
         considered referral services for purposes of determining if a physician/group is at
         substantial financial risk. For example, an MCO may require a physician group/physician to
         authorize "retroactive" referrals for emergency care received outside the MCO's network. If
         the physician group/physician's payment from the MCO can be affected by the utilization of
         emergency care, such as a bonus if emergency referrals are low, then these emergency
         services are considered referral services and need to be included in the calculation of
         substantial financial risk. Also, if a physician group contracts with an individual
         physician or another group to provide services that the initial group cannot provide
         itself, any services referred to the contracted physician group/physician should be
         considered referral services.</definition>

      <term-name>SUMMARIZED COST RATE</term-name>
      <definition>The ratio of the present value of expenditures to the present value of the taxable
         payroll for the years in a given period. In this context, the expenditures are on an
         incurred basis and exclude costs for those uninsured persons for whom payments are
         reimbursed from the general fund of the Treasury, and for voluntary enrollees, who pay a
         premium in order to be enrolled. The summarized cost rate includes the cost of reaching and
         maintaining a "target" trust fund level, known as a contingency fund ratio. Because a trust
         fund level of about 1 year's expenditures is considered to be an adequate reserve for
         unforeseen contingencies, the targeted contingency fund ratio used in determining
         summarized cost rates is 100 percent of annual expenditures. Accordingly, the summarized
         cost rate is equal to the ratio of (1) the sum of the present value of the outgo during the
         period, plus the present value of the targeted ending trust fund level, plus the beginning
         trust fund level, to (2) the present value of the taxable payroll during the
         period.</definition>

         record information, or interpret previously recorded information, for a specific purpose.
         Thus, a syntax is a grammar. Such rules and conventions may be either explicit or implicit.
         In X12 transactions, the data-element separators, the sub-element separators, the segment
         terminators, the segment identifiers, the loops, the loop identifiers (when present), the
         repetition factors, etc., are all aspects of the X12 syntax. When explicit, such
         syntactical elements tend to be the structural, or format-related, data elements that are
         not required when a direct data entry architecture is used. Ultimately, though, there is
         not a perfectly clear division between the syntactical elements and the business data
         content.</definition>

         requested through the Agency for Health Research and Quality (AHRQ). For a description of

      <term-name>TEST OF LONG-RANGE CLOSE ACTUARIAL BALANCE</term-name>
      <definition>Summarized income rates and cost rates are calculated for each of 66 valuation
         periods within the full 75-year long-range projection period under the intermediate
         assumptions. The first of these periods consists of the next 10 years. Each succeeding
         period becomes longer by 1 year, culminating with the period consisting of the next 75
         years. The long-range test is met if, for each of the 66 time periods, the actuarial
         balance is not less than zero or is negative by, at most, a specified percentage of the
         summarized cost rate for the same time period. The percentage allowed for a negative
         actuarial balance is 5 percent for the full 75-year period and is reduced uniformly for
         shorter periods, approaching zero as the duration of the time periods approaches the first
         10 years. The criterion for meeting the test is less stringent for the longer periods in
         recognition of the greater uncertainty associated with estimates for more distant years.
         This test is applied to trust fund projections made under the intermediate
         assumptions.</definition>
   </term>
   <term>
      <term-name>TEST OF SHORT-RANGE FINANCIAL ADEQUACY</term-name>
      <definition>The conditions required to meet this test are as follows: (1) If the trust fund
         ratio for a fund exceeds 100 percent at the beginning of the projection period, then it
         must be projected to remain at or above 100 percent throughout the 10-year projection
         period; (2) alternatively, if the fund ratio is initially less than 100 percent, it must be
         projected to reach a level of at least 100 percent within 5 years (and not be depleted at
         any time during this period), and then remain at or above 100 percent throughout the rest
         of the 10-year period. This test is applied to trust fund projections made under the
         intermediate assumptions.</definition>
